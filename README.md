# VR
TP1
Input: 3D point set A and B with N points (N= 2,3,4â€¦)
You can put the point set A and B in the program or require the users to give the value of N and N points for A and N points for B
Output: matrix R and t, error
You should show the matrix M and t in screen and show the estimated error

TP2
Input: a video or image sequences with the link in the program or the link given by the users
Output: optical flow images (show in the screen or save in one directory)
You should analyze the results in several sentences. 
You can use OpenCV and optical flow algorithm installed in OpenCV
